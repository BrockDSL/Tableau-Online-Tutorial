# Introduction to Tableau Online  
A beginners guide to making interactive data visualisations using Tableau Online



### Getting Started  
First things first you will need to download the files that we will be using for this tutorial.  Navigate to each of the links below.  You will be taken to a GitHub page showing the data.  Right click on the "Raw" button at the top right of the data and select "save link as" to save the files to your computer.  
  
[File 1](Order-Contents.csv)  
[File 2](Order-Details.csv)  
  

Next you will need to log in to Tableau Online.  Navigate to the [login page](https://sso.online.tableau.com/public/idp/SSO) and enter your login information.  If you do not have a login you can request a free trial of the full version of Tableau Online [here](https://www.tableau.com/trial/tableau-online).  
  
  
Once you have logged in you should arrive at you Tableau Home Screen.  Your Home screen on Tableau can be changed so to make sure that you are on the correct screen, click on the "Projects" tab.

Now we will create a new project by clicking on the "New Project" button.  In the new project popup enter the title you want to use and a description of the project.  For this example we will use "Shipping Data Analytics" as our project name and will describe it as "Learning to use Tableau is awesome!".
